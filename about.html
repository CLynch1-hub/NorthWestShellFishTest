          <h3>From the Founder</h3>
          <p><strong>North West Shellfish Ltd</strong> was formed in 1992 with a view to producing scallops in aquaculture licensed sites in Mulroy Bay. We have done that very successfully ever since, collecting the spat from the wild in artificial collectors, growing them through a nursery stage in suspended culture for two years using trays and lantern nets, and then placing them on the seabed for growout.</p>

          <p>This is all done in a sustainable, environmentally friendly way, and we dive-harvest them to avoid disturbing the seabed.</p>

          <p>In 2019, we were granted aquaculture licenses to produce 13 seaweed species and 10 shellfish species. Since then, we’ve engaged in seaweed production and native oyster cultivation.</p>

          <p>We operate within an Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) system, which improves both our local marine environment and contributes positively to the global ecosystem.</p>

          <p>We are currently developing a marine hatchery to secure reliable seed supply for multiple shellfish and seaweed species, and to support other producers.</p>

          <p>Over the years, we’ve partnered in many domestic and international projects, and we remain committed to collaborating with others to advance aquaculture across Europe and beyond.</p>
