    <h2>Our Company in the News</h2>
    <p>Mulroy Bay has been recognised internationally as a model for organic aquaculture. 
      In a recent <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2024/05/28/fishers-turn-to-seaweed-farming" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Euronews Green feature</a>, 
      local fishers and innovators highlighted how seaweed farming is transforming Donegal’s coastal economy.</p>

    <p>Jerry Gallagher, a former fisherman, explained: <em>“The effort per catch now is huge… I wouldn’t do it.”</em> 
      His family turned to aquaculture after fish stocks declined, finding new opportunity in cultivating mussels, oysters, and seaweed.</p>

    <p>Lorraine Gallagher, general manager of The Seaweed Company, added: <em>“We have such an amazing coastline here in Ireland… there’s huge potential with seaweed!”</em></p>

    <p>Seaweed farming offers off-season employment, supports biodiversity, and produces nutrient-rich food with proven gut health benefits. 
      Their Donegal facility processes up to 300 kg per hour into flakes for the food industry, showing how tradition and innovation can thrive together.</p>

  <h2>Seaweed Farming: A Sustainable Future</h2>
  <p>Mulroy Bay has been recognised internationally as a model for organic aquaculture.

      <h3>Local Heritage</h3>
      <p>Jerry Gallagher, once a fisherman, turned to aquaculture after fish stocks declined. His daughter Lorraine, trained in human nutrition, now manages the family’s seaweed company, cultivating <strong>Atlantic Wakame (Alaria esculenta)</strong>.</p>

  <div class="about-block">
    <div class="about-text">
      <h3>Farming Cycle & Employment</h3>
      <p>Seeding begins in <strong>October</strong> and by <strong>April</strong> the seaweed is ready for harvest. This cycle provides off‑season employment for fishers and mussel farmers, sustaining local livelihoods.</p>

  <div class="about-block">
    <div class="about-text">
      <h3>Innovation & Nutrition</h3>
      <p>Their factory processes up to <strong>300 kg per hour</strong> into flakes for the food industry. Seaweed blends can even substitute meat — a <strong>25% seaweed meat blend</strong reduces environmental impact while boosting gut health, fibre, calcium, and magnesium.</p>
    </div>
    
  </div>

  <div class="about-block">
    <div class="about-text">
      <h3>Global & Environmental Impact</h3>
      <p>Supported by the EU’s <strong>Algae Initiative</strong>, seaweed farming helps restore ocean health and protect coastlines from erosion. Europe currently produces only <strong>0.2% of global algae</strong but imports €500M annually — highlighting the growth potential for Donegal’s farms.</p>
